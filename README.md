# CyberSecFrameworks

**Idea:** 

This Repo_Guide should act as a Guideline to correctly correspond the CSF 2.0 and the other NIST SP 800-53 and 800-63 in relation to each other. Target Group SME. 


Here is a summary of the most important publications and guides on cybersecurity by NIST:

## NIST CSF
**NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0**: Provides guidance to manage cybersecurity risks and offers a taxonomy of high-level cybersecurity outcomes. It does not prescribe how outcomes should be achieved but links to online resources for additional guidance.

## NIST SP 800-53
**NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5**: Provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for information systems and organizations to protect from a diverse set of threats and risks. The controls are flexible, customizable, and implemented as part of an organization-wide process to manage risk.

**NIST SP 800-53A REV. 5**: Provides a methodology and set of procedures for conducting assessments of security and privacy controls employed within systems and organizations within an effective risk management framework.

**NIST SP 800-53B**: Provides security and privacy control baselines for the Federal Government. There are three security control baselines (one for each system impact levelâ€”low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact), as well as a privacy baseline that is applied to systems irrespective of impact level.

## SP 800-63 Special Publication
**SP 800-63-3 Digital Identity Guidelines**: Provides technical requirements for federal agencies implementing digital identity services. The guidelines cover identity proofing and authentication of users interacting with government IT systems over open networks.

**SP 800-63A Enrollment and Identity Proofing**: Focuses on the enrollment and verification of an identity for use in digital authentication. Central to this is a process known as identity proofing in which an applicant provides evidence to a credential service provider (CSP) reliably identifying themselves.

**SP 800-63B Authentication and Lifecycle Management**: Focuses on the authentication of subjects interacting with government systems over open networks, establishing that a given claimant is a subscriber who has been previously authenticated.

**SP 800-63C Federation and Assertions**: Provides technical and procedural guidelines to agencies for the implementation of federated identity systems and for assertions used by federations. This guideline focuses on the use of federated identity and the use of assertions to implement identity federations.
